                <p2>site report</p2>

                <p>This website takes a large amount of inspiration from Google Material Design 3 as I thought it looks
                    genuinely nice to the eyes and it would also be an extra challenge to create something that lives up
                    to their design guidelines. <a href="https://m3.material.io/">(https://m3.material.io/)</a></p>
                <p>I also made use of the Mozilla CSS docs and W3S to help with my coding</p>
                <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)</a></p>
                <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">(https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)</a></p>
                <p>To begin this site started as a basic form of the lesson site. the colours didn't look very nice, so
                    I swapped them out for a set of designated variables that correspond to a material pallet. I then
                    assigned them to the key elements that would be coloured.</p>
                <p>after that, I decided to get rid of the aside and footer as they cluttered up the homepage. plus,
                    they could just be made into an extra page.
                    next, I got a rough feel of the grid I would need by using <a href="https://grid.layoutit.com/">(https://grid.layoutit.com/)</a> this allowed
                    me to properly visualise how the grid would look on the home page.
                </p>
                <p>After applying the grid, I got to styling the 3 primary sections with CSS. The nav the header and the
                    main. as I messed around with the rounded corners I settled on a rounded box as the main content
                    with the nav and the header having the same background. to make this work I made the box scrollable,
                    so it was like its own little main content island. and of course, with this I had to make sure that
                    the scrollbar was correctly styled.</p>
                <p>After I was decently happy with the desktop home page I begun the mobile optimisation phase. This
                    started with having the grid area be single file and the navbar pushed out of existence. This part
                    was particularly painful as creating and moving the hamburger icon around proved to be a massive
                    pain, but I got it done in the end. The next issue was then making sure that the nav bar appeared
                    and disappeared on hamburger click.</p>
                <p>I could not get the nav to appear and disappear using just CSS for the life of me, so I had to resort
                    to using JS to run a function that switched the style header. After a few days of trial and error I
                    was able to ger that up and running with as few lines as possible. As a bonus of discovering the
                    power of JS I was also able to implement a dark and light theme transition on the nav bar. This was
                    possible because of my previous use of colour variables I only needed to link a style sheet with the
                    light version of my colours which allowed me to make the switch seamlessly.</p>
                <p>Next was the animating part of the nav bar in the mobile view. I wanted it to swing out on press and
                    retract. Witch proved most difficult as I had to completely redesign the way the button press worked
                    but as a result, I was able to learn about animation curves <a
                        href="https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/easing-and-duration/tokens-specs">(https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/easing-and-duration/tokens-specs)</a>
                    and this made CSS animations
                    clear to me. So, I was able to make the swinging navbar in mobile view and animate the transition of
                    light and dark mode. I was also able to give the navbar a background in the mobile view to make it
                    look like a sliding card. And make the links phase in as the mouse hovered over it.</p>
                <p>The next issue I addressed was the content and its scaling. This was an issue as the content did not
                    scale well when shrunk into mobile view or expanded across 2 desktops. I aimed to make sure that the
                    content was standardised across all page views, so I had to create an invisible content div inside
                    the main div this was the main constrictor of the content and made sure that it scaled evenly across
                    window sizes. This turned out to be a good idea as it helped massively in the project page where I
                    altered the gird to have multiple scrollable cards in the main div which all needed to scale
                    correctly. Making sure that the paddings and margins resized according to the window.</p>
